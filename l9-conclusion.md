# Lesson9: Conclusion


## Course Summary

- In this short course you've learned about `two key principles` for prompting : 
  - Write clear and specific instructions
  - And when it's appropriate, give the model time to think. 

- You also learned about iterative prompt development and how having a 
process to get to the prompt that's right for your application is key. 

- And we went through a few capabilities of large language models that are useful for many applications, specifically 

Summarizing, inferring, transforming, and expanding. 
And you also saw how to build a  custom chatbot. 

- That was a lot that you learned in just one short course, and I hope you enjoyed going through these materials. 

- We hope you'll come up with some ideas for applications that you can build yourself now. Please go try this out and let us know what you come up with. 

- No application is too small, it's fine to start with something that's kind of a very small project with maybe a little bit of utility or maybe it's not even useful at all, it's just something fun. 

- Yeah, and I find playing with these models actually really fun, 
so go play with it! 

- I agree, it's a good weekend activity, speaking 
from experience. 

- Uhm, and just, you know, please use the learnings from your first project to build a better second project and you know, maybe even a better third project, so on. 

- That's kind of how I have kind of grown over time using these models myself as well.

- Or if you have an idea for a bigger project already, 
just go for it. 

- And you know, as a reminder, these kind of large language models are a very powerful technology, so it kind of goes without saying that we ask you to use them responsibly and please only build things that will have a positive impact. 

- I think in this age, people that build AI systems can have a huge impact on others. 

- So it's more important than ever that all of us only use these tools responsibly. Uhm, and I think building large language model based applications is just a very exciting and growing field right now. 

- And now that you've finished this course, I think you now have a wealth of knowledge that let you build things that few people today know how to. 

- So, I hope you also help us to spread the word and encourage others to 
take this course too. 

In closing, I hope you had fun doing this course, and I want to thank you for finishing this course. 

- And both Isa and I look forward to hearing about the amazing things that you build.

# Lesson6: Transforming

## Overview

In this notebook, we will explore how to use Large Language Models for text transformation tasks such as **language translation, spelling and grammar checking, tone adjustment, and format conversion**.


## Transformation Tasks 

### Translation

- ChatGPT is trained with sources in many languages. This gives the model the ability to do translation. Here are some examples of how to use this capability.

### Universal Translator

- Imagine you are in charge of IT at a large multinational e-commerce company. Users are messaging you with IT issues in all their native languages. Your staff is from all over the world and speaks only their native languages. You need a universal translator!

### Tone Transformation

- Writing can vary based on the intended audience. ChatGPT can produce different tones.

### Format Conversion

- ChatGPT can translate between formats. The prompt should describe the input and output formats.


### Spellcheck/Grammar check

- Here are some examples of common grammar and spelling problems and the LLM's response.

- To signal to the LLM that you want it to proofread your text, you instruct the model to 'proofread' or 'proofread and correct'.

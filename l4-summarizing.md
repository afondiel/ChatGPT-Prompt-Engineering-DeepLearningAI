# Lesson4: Summarizing




## Text to summarize

```python
prod_review = """
Got this panda plush toy for my daughter's birthday, \
who loves it and takes it everywhere. It's soft and \ 
super cute, and its face has a friendly look. It's \ 
a bit small for what I paid though. I think there \ 
might be other options that are bigger for the \ 
same price. It arrived a day earlier than expected, \ 
so I got to play with it myself before I gave it \ 
to her.
"""
```

## Summarization techniques 

- Summarize with a word/sentence/character limit
- Summarize with a focus on shipping and delivery
- Summarize with a focus on price and value
- Try "extract" instead of "summarize"
- Summarize multiple product reviews

Check the [notebook](./lab/l4-summarizing.ipynb) to see the examples for each of those techniques

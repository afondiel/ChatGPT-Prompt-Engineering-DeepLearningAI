# Lesson5: Inferring

## Overview 

In this lesson, you will infer `sentiment` and `topics` from product reviews and news articles.

`Infering` : the model takes a text as input some tasks and performs some kinds of analysis.
- Ex: Extracting lables, names, understand the sentiment of text, etc

**Inferring LLM vs classical ML Model**
-  classical ML Model : 
   -  complex and slow process
   -  need of a different model for each task (extraction, sentiment analysis..)
-  LLM models : much faster and all you is a `prompt`
   -  only need one API (model) to perform many different tasks

## Application & examples

Check out the [notebook](./lab/l5-inferring.ipynb) to see the code examples.
